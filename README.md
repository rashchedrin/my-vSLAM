# my-vSLAM
This implementation of vSLAM was my bachelor's diploma project. 
This is visual-based monocular SLAM, implemented as a ROS node. It uses Extended Kalman Filter and ORB features to build a map. There is also implemented a simple method for initialization, but it only works in perfect conditions.
